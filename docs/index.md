# Welcome to Tidal Tales
Tidal Tales is an innovative suite of tools designed to enable scientific research of Instagram Stories. Just as the tide ebbs and flows with predictable certainty, our project is built on the premise of capturing the transient yet impactful narratives that unfold on Instagramâ€”twice a day, every day. This methodical approach ensures no story is missed, mirroring the natural rhythm of the tides in our quest to archive and analyze digital narratives.
