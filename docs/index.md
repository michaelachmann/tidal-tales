# Welcome to Tidal Tales
Tidal Tales is a project designed for social science research, focusing on the capture and analysis of ephemeral Instagram Stories. At its core is a custom Firefox extension that allows researchers to collect story metadata and media files directly onto their own computers, ensuring full control over data privacy and security. This extension, combined with manuals for effective data collection, provides a robust framework for conducting retrospective content analysis of Instagram Stories. Tidal Tales offers a secure and efficient method for archiving and studying transient digital narratives.

    Our Firefox plugin facilitates data collection while browsing. Simply watch the Instagram Stories of your selected profiles to create your corpus. The plugin supports both one-time data collections and long-term studies, storing all data directly on your local machine.

    The Firefox plugin collects Instagram Stories as you watch them and stores both the media files (images and videos) and associated metadata directly on your computer. This ensures that all data remains securely under your control without reliance on external servers.
